# Supermarket Sales Analysis

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of supermarket sales transactions. The Jupyter notebook `complete-data-analysis-visualisation.ipynb` loads the dataset, cleans it, and analyzes different attributes through visualizations to gain insights.

## Data
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and contains 1,000 sales transactions from a supermarket. Each transaction includes attributes such as:

- City
- Customer type 
- Gender
- Product line
- Unit price
- Quantity
- Tax
- Total
- Payment method
- Rating

## Analysis
The analysis focuses on exploring various attributes in the data through visualizations to find insights such as:

- Male vs female customers
- Sales per product line 
- Top cities by customers
- Payment methods used
- Gross income per product 
- Average ratings
- Correlations between attributes

Various plots are generated with Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:

- Counts
- Bar plots
- Distributions


## Key Insights
Some of the key insights from the analysis are:

- Similar number of male and female customers
- Food & beverages have the best average rating
- Home & lifestyle has the highest gross income
- Majority paid through e-wallet
- Most customers are from Yangon city
- Females generate more sales in fashion while males in health & beauty

The notebook provides a thorough analysis to understand supermarket sales and customer behavior. The visualizations and summary showcase how exploratory analysis can provide powerful insights.
